# DB Delay Charts

## How to Use

You need a client ID and an API key to use the scripts `fetch_planned.py` and `fetch_changes.py`. You can get them at [DB API Marketplace](https://developers.deutschebahn.com/db-api-marketplace). Make sure not to share that data.

The other scripts can be used without adjustments.
